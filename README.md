# sand

This is an implementation of an abelian sandpile in Haskell. The images are just
ridiculously beautiful, and I just wanted to make one for myself. It outputs
grayscale ppm files. Preview in MacOS can handle these. I'm sure you can open
them in other operating systems too.

It ran for about 100 minutes to topple 100,000 grains, so beware if you're going
to run this. Consider changing 100,000 to something of a smaller order of magnitude if you just want to quickly see it go.
